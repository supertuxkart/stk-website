Licensing is not the most exciting topic, but if you wish to contribute, you will absolutely need to read it.

## Why

SuperTuxKart is included in many Linux distributions with strict license requirements (e.g. Debian). We cannot accept tracks/karts/textures/etc. with unclear licensing terms as this could result in SuperTuxKart being removed from their repositories, or, worse, getting sued.

Furthermore, stk-assets is hosted (freely, I might add) by SourceForge, which require that all hosted materials be released under open licenses; therefore posting materials with improper licenses would violate our terms of hosting and be rude to the kind people who provide this hosting.

## STK Code

The source code of SuperTuxKart is released under GPL v3.0 (we updated all files to use this version by making use of the "or (at your option) any later version" clause of the GPL).

## Considerations to always keep in mind

Here's the information you should write down about any artwork you make (don't forget to include the same information about any other artwork you integrate into your work) or someone else's artwork that you share. Artwork includes textures, concept art, tracks, karts, 3D models, and any other artistic work. Note that while it's OK to license a track as a whole under a single license, you must still credit the authors of individual components.

* Author's name (legal name and pseudonym, if possible)
* Year of publication (copyright year—if possible)
* License(s) under which the work is published
* URL of where you found the artwork (It's a good idea to save the page on the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org) too, in case it goes offline.)
* If you made a modified version and upgrade the license version, still note down the original license.

If you fail to provide the necessary information, your work will be included neither in core SuperTuxKart nor add-ons!

If you reuse a texture from another STK track, still note down the information above in case the texture is later removed from core STK.

Also be sure that you have the right to actually release the art work under the license you chose. Some (usually commercial) software might restrict what you are allowed to do with anything created with that software. If the software includes bundled sound or image samples, be sure to follow the publisher's licensing requirements if you integrate the samples into your work.

## Brands, corporations etc

Trademarked logo and brands aren't allowed in SuperTuxKart. Instead if you want to add a company or a corporation you can use fictional ones from our [universe](Style).

## Which licenses?

They are listed in order of most to least restrictive in the "abbreviation" column to the left. All BSD licenses include an attribution (copyright notice) requirement and a disclaimer of liability. Additionally, the BSD-4 and BSD-3 include a restriction on the use of the author's name in promotion of modified versions of the product. (Note: the latter requirement still implicitly applies under the BSD-2 and BSD-simplified since this is considered a right in most countries that cannot be taken away without explicit forfeiture.) The BSD-4 includes a controversial clause requiring attribution in advertisements and is not recommended. The BSD-2 includes a statement that the views expressed in the software or documentation are the author's and not the organization's. The BSD-simplified does not include the latter statement. | Works under all BSD licenses EXCEPT the BSD-4 may be integrated into GPL works and probably many others, provided you remember to note down what license the original was under.

Of course, this makes little sense for artistic works, where multiple works could be stored in the same file but still be able to be separated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Only of particular note is that MPLv2 works can be integrated into differently-licensed works, provided that the MPLv2 works remain under the MPLv2 despite the "larger work" being distributed under a different license. However this is not really applicable for artistic works as e.g. including an MPLv2-licensed 3D model in a GPL-licensed track doesn't constitute a larger work since the two objects remain separable, unlike a compiled program.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

{%popup_info Note that **even if you modify the work** (image, model, etc.), in general you do **not have the legal right to change the license** of your modified version; changing of license must be explicitly granted by the license of the work in question, or by the author. Some licenses like the GPL or CC-BY-SA expressly limit your choice of license for derivative works, while others can continue to subtly apply to your modified version after you re-license, such as the CC-BY, which requires attribution even if you change the license.%}

### Licenses requiring modification before inclusion

{%popup_info I find this section a little dangerous. Reading in the Debian mailing list, it looks like some CC 1.0/2.x restrictions on attribution could come back to haunt you even if you license a derivative under a later version. Also why isn't the CC-BY 1.0 OK?%}

These licenses are unacceptable for works submitted to SuperTuxKart, but if you make a *significant* change to a work of art under one of these licenses (for instance crop it and make it repeatable to build a texture), then you are allowed to release your modified version of the image under a later version the same license. What constitutes a significant modification is open for lawyers to debate upon but as long as your modified version does not look like a copy of the original we won't be picky.

### Unacceptable Licenses

Do not attempt to submit modified or unmodified versions of works under these licenses:

* GNU Free Documentation License (all versions)
* Creative Commons Sampling 1.0
* Creative Commons Sampling Plus 1.0
* Any Creative Commons licenses version 1.0
* Any Creative Commons licenses with the *no derivatives* (ND) clause
* Any Creative Commons licenses with the *non-commercial* (NC) clause
* Free Art License (Licence Art Libre)—due to confusion with the translation from French
* [Image\*After Terms](http://imageafter.com/)
* [Texturelib License](http://texturelib.com/license)
* "Creative Commons" without a full name including the version number (because Creative Commons is an organization, not a license.)
* "I-asked-the-guy-and-he-said-I-could-use-it." This is not a license, and even if you have it in writing it doesn't tell you what legal restrictions apply. Ask for an explicit statement, or ask the person to copy and sign/re-post the one below:

> I, \<name here\>, agree to release my artistic work, \<name of work here\>, under the terms of the \<name of license here\>.

For other licenses, we need to check on a case-by-case basis. The [Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses) provides more details on other licenses along with [GNU's page](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html) about licenses.

## Documenting Licenses

Note: If you've made a library node or texture to be included in SuperTuxKart main, just provide the information required above to whoever is in charge of including your artwork and the licensing information will be added for you.

So, you've dutifully gathered all the information needed that's listed above. Now what? For any add-on kart, track, or arena, you will need to include this information in an organized way in a file called `licenses.txt` in the same folder as the **exported** kart or track's files.

The preferred way to document the licenses for your kart/track/arena/etc. in `licenses.txt` is to follow the [Debian Machine-Readable Copyright File Format](https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/). This ensures a standardized way to keep track of licenses and makes it easy to look up the license of your work should a controversy ever arise. Here is an example of what your `licenses.txt` might look like for an add-on kart:
