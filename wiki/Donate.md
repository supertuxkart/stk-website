To install the package, first retrieve the "1.5 Gift Package" on itch.io, unzip the file, and follow the instructions in the included README. The procedure follows the [manual addons installation](Installing_Add-Ons) procedure.

Unfortunately as of now, we are not able to offer an in-game installation procedure or a simple installation procedure for Android users. We are aware of this limitation, but we didn't want to delay 1.5's release to all users to solve it.
